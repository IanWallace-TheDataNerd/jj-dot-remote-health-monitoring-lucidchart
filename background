# Global Health Connection — Case Study Background (J&J)

## Background
Johnson & Johnson works with governments and vendors to improve access to healthcare services worldwide. In rural or underdeveloped areas, many patients cannot receive treatment because it takes too much time, cost, and resources to travel to a provider. Healthcare providers are limited and cannot service every patient who needs care. Many regions also do not have the budget to hire additional providers or build strong transportation infrastructure. As a result, patients often go untreated, lack medical education, and rarely receive preventive care such as annual physicals.

## Project Goal
Develop a technical solution that allows healthcare providers to diagnose and/or treat patients in remote locations.

## Current Process Steps
- Patient has an illness/injury  
- Patient either goes untreated or walks/travels many miles for healthcare assistance

## Voice of the Customer
- “It would be easier if I could monitor patients’ history/health information on an on-going basis. Many of the patients I see have health issues that could’ve been prevented by monitoring simple stats from an annual physical.”  
  — Dr. Samuel Maroon, M.D.

- “Getting someone to diagnose & suggest treatment is so difficult. I have to walk 35 miles to get any medical attention/advice. If I don’t feel well, I don’t always feel like walking that many miles, so often I’ll just ignore my symptoms, until they flare up again.”  
  — Mr. Red, Patient

- “There are numerous occasions where patients go untreated, because they are uneducated about their diagnosis and treatment options. It would be much more useful if I could talk to my patients at the very least to determine what patients can do to help their own treatment.”  
  — Dr. Norah Brown, M.D.
