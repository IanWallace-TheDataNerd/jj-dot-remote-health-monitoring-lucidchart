Solution Context: J&J Dot Remote Monitoring Patch

The J&J Dot is a remote health monitoring patch designed for patients with limited mobility and people living in rural areas. 
It continuously tracks patient vital signs and sends the data to the nearest hospital so providers can monitor patients in real time.

The patch supports two emergency options. It can trigger an automatic SOS alert when vitals show signs of danger, and it also includes a manual SOS button for emergencies that may not be detected through vitals. 
Alerts are organized using a four-level urgency system to help hospitals prioritize responses.

The solution also collects geographic usage data to show where remote monitoring is needed most, which can help improve planning and resource allocation. 
For security, access to patient information is protected using barcode authentication and a security question through the companion app or over the phone.
